    :end-before: intro


Other packages, applications and services can register database objects through standard Python entry point in
``setup.py``. See the :doc:`usage` documentation on how to take advantage of this package.

This module is based on the source code of `Invenio-DB <https://invenio-db.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
Thanks the Invenio Team for providing a scalable way to deal with dynamic database models with `Flask-SQLALchemy <https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/>`_.
